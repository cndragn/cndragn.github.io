I wish I kept up with weekly posts my last couple weeks at Wyncode, but it really moved so fast and became such a blur.  Those final weeks felt like just 3 or 4 insanely long days.  Not only am I dreaming of code, one morning I woke up and lay there for far too long trying to find a solution to something I was trying to write in my dreams. I have officially lost it!

I will try to summarize my experience working on a dev team for our final project. My teammates were Johanna, one of the students who came from Sweden specifically to attend Wyncode (how cool is that?!) and Will, a really cool accomplished comedian.  Johanna and I got along and worked together amazingly.  Will and I got along too..as long as it didn't involve the project! Ahh!! 

It was both infuriating and awesome...infuriating because we did not see eye to eye on anything. Awesome because after our first heated disagreement on day one, we came up with a game plan so that we could work together. The most important part was, no more project decisions without Johanna there to keep us calm, she has a gift for that! We stuck to all the things we agreed to, and it really came into play and was worth it because when we hit roadblocks, we were able to get over it and move forward as a team in no time.

Going through an experience like that really was a great learning experience. While life would have been easier if we all got along, I learned a ton about conflict resolution, growth mindset, knowing when to stand your ground and when to compromise, how to let things go and move on, how to stay focused and productive even when you wanna kill the person next to you, or a bit worried they may want to kill you. Hah! Through it all, we maintained respect for each other, Will and I came out of it good friends and we even joke about it now.  Won’t be so funny if we actually end up on the same dev team again! But let’s cross that bridge when we get to it haha!
