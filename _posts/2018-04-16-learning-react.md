I've been working my way through the React lessons on FreeCodeCamp and just like with their JavaScript courses, its is very good.  There are some points where I need some extra info to help me solve the challenges, so I also decided to take the React course on CodeCademey to help me along.

Doing it this way helps me out a lot.  I like how both of these sites teach...instead of just telling me to do this or that, they teach the concept, then provide a challenge I should be able to solve after learning about the concept. 

I'm not sure if its fair to say CodeCademy is easier...I am able to get through it faster than FCC which can be downright challenging at times, but it also offers a bit more info to help me understand things which I can take back to FCC to help me along...

So far so good though, nothing has me really stumped. It really just feels like html and css written in a bit of a different way.  The concept of component is easy enough, I'm just hoping that when it comes to applying everything I'm learning, it will still make sense!
