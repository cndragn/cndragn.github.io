I have what I think is a pretty good idea for a vacation app. Now that I've learned React, I would like to put it to good use and build my app with Rails in the back end and React in the front end.  I got everything all set up, and then I stared at it..and stared at it.  Kinda realized I have no idea where to even start!  I'm sure I just need to relax and take things step by step, but feeling kind of overwhelmed with all my ideas of what needs to be done, and how to get just that first bit started so that I can take off.

Something really cool though is I made my very first ever real git pull request and it was approved!  I'm a part of Operation Code, an organization to help veterans in tech. They are very learner / beginner friendly. The site is built on Rails, so I head over, found a issue report that I could fix, fixed it, did my pull request and voila! I don't know why its so scary to make changes on someone elses project, and so nervewrecking waiting with hope they will approve it, but I do feel like having gotten my first time out of the way, I can move on to do more stuff like that and contribute to more projects.
