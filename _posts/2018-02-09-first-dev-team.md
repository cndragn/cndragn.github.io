title: "Wyncode Week 5: First Dev Team!"
date: 2018-02-09

This week was both exciting and nervewrecking!  We learned about Rails, MVC and deploying our app on Heroku.  The most challenging part of Rails is understanding what exactly goes into the controller and the models....okay and the views too.  We also continued to learn more about Agile and project planning. Looming ahead of us was the knowledge that we would need to start, and finish our first dev project by next week. The pressure to understand everything we were learning was intense!

On Thurday was Pitch Day and graduation day for Cohort 21, so we got a glimpse into our future.  It was pretty exciting to see everyones project, but it was hard not to be nervous about what we will be expected to do in only 5 more weeks.  Deep breaths! One day at a time!!!

On Friday we were split up into dev teams. We didn't get to choose, because that would be too easy right?!  Everyone was on pins and needles wondering who we would get to work with, and what project we would end up doing.  The one thing we could choose was our project...we had our choice of easy: a scraper app, medium: an api app and hard: an ecommerce site.  I was teamed up with Kalil and Jeff and while I wanted to do the ecommerce site, we compromised and decided to do a mix of easy and hard and incorporate both scraping and instragram-style api.  So far so good!

We don't have a lot of time to work on this..our code freeze is on Monday, then we have to work on our presentation for Friends and Family day on Thursday.  So we hit the ground running, started coming up with ideas and splitting up what we'll work on.  Our project will be a city explorer app...search for a city, select a category and photos for that city and category will appear.  We have a lot of other ideas, but not sure what we can finish in just a few days. Kalil and I will work on the backend and Jeff will be working on the front end. I sense a lot of late nights ahead...whew!
