title: "Wyncode Week 7: More Rails"
date: 2018-02-23
---

This week was rails..rails..and more rails!  Last week I wondered what more we could possibly learn that we didn't already apply to our Friends and Family project.. turns out, quite a bit!  We learned even more about controllers, which really is great because it cleared up a lot of confusion I had when we first learned about it last week. Already I can think of some improvements I need to make on my project when I get some time, which is great..I would like to keep working on it and make it better.

On Tuesday we had an alumni panel, where some Wyncode alumni came in to talk to us about what life after Wyncode has been like and what they are doing now.  One of them is a project manager and his job sounded really interesting.  Everything we've been learning about Agile really came full circle as he talked about his role and also his advantage managing developers since he understands development himself.  I never considered project management before, but it sounded really interesting so I reached out to him on LinkedIn to see if he can tell me more.

Today we had Wynterview Prep...Wynterview is where Wyncode brings in hiring partners to interview us and hopefully offer us a job. Today's prep was discuss what the process is like, what to expect, how to get prepared, get our resume and LinkedIn in order, all that fun stuff. It feels really wierd, we just made it through the halfway point and did our Friends and Family presentation...interviews already?! But we are very close to done... on Monday we get our teams for our final project and in two more weeks will be our final pitch and graduation night.  It really feels like we just went to Cohort 21's Pitch night My concept of time is out the door.

"Code. Sleep. Eat. Repeat" (Well, we keep getting irresistible catered food at Wyncode so there should probably add a couple more eats, and a few dozen "Drink Coffee" in there too...realistically speaking.)
