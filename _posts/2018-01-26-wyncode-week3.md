I had wanted to start this blog at the beginning of my Wyncode journey, but things have been such a whirlwind lately that I just havn't had the chance to get my blog going until now.  First, I suppose I'll start with what my Wyncode journey is, along with a bit about myself and how I got to this point.  

## What is Wyncode?

<img src="/blog/images/wyncode-logo.png" align ="left"><p>Wyncode Academy is an intense, immersive 10-week coding school based in Miami, FL.  While considering my options, I found that Wyncode is very involved in the local tech community, holds and is a part of many events, which is important to me.  I also learned that they have a couple hundred local hiring partners and work hard to connect them with students.  Even before becoming a student, I was invited to events, one of them a talk with the CTO of GE Digital. It made a huge impact on me that they put the effort in to legitimately bring students, hiring partners and the tech community together.</p>

They teach Ruby and Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Agile and Im sure Im forgetting some things. Class sizes are relatively small, not quite 30 students. We have 2 teachers assistants in class, plus there are more TA's available after class, and the cohort ahead of us are super cool with helping anyone who needs it as well.  Most of the logistical details and course specifics can be found on their website. What I'd like to eventually blog about are the things they do not include on there, like things that surprised me, as well as stuff I just did not think about before coming here. -  [http://Wyncode.co](http://Wyncode.co)

## A Bit About myself

I first started learning programming back in middle school. My brother-in-law sent me a computer loaded up with games, but when it arrived, it had wiped clean in shipping. Luckily, he tossed in some programming books, and so I was introduced to BASIC and C++.  I dabbled in programming up til I joined the Army after high school.  After the military, I learned HTML and CSS and started freelancing on the side of my career in sales.  

Last year, I decided I wanted to return to my first love and make this into my career.  I started with learning JavaScript on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), then concepts of computer science, along with C on [CS50X](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/), then I decided I should think about learning ReactJS..well, the whole MERN stack, oh! And Python too!! Do you see where this is going??  Basically, I felt like I was spinning my wheels, not getting anywhere, and even though I learned a lot, I did not feel I knew all that much. That's when I decided to look into coding schools and found Wyncode.

## First impressions: Cohort 22

My teacher, Ed Toro, is an MIT grad and been a part of start ups along with a bunch of other things that would make you nod your head and think "Oh! Well that is quite good!""  He comes off as super serious, but I had the chance to talk with him before classes started and already knew that he's actually pretty cool. I was excited to have him as my teacher and so far that hasn't changed. My class TA's Don and Angel help us out, grade our homework, lead class and do extra sessions.  They are super approachable and helpful.

The students are a really diverse mix of people of all backgrounds, ages, walks of life, prior careers, and coding experience. It's interesting to me how we started out as total strangers, and by the end of the first week, we had spent so much time together we already interacted with each other as if we'd known each other for months.  At the three week mark, things are pretty tight knit.

I'm excited to be here and looking forward to what's to come!
