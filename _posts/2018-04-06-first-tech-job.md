When people would ask me what life after Wyncode is like, I would say it’s kind of like leaving home. I’m excited to finally be on my own and want to get out in the world and show off everything I can do.  But deep down, hope to come back on the weekends to hang out in my old room, get some laundry done and eat some home cooking.  Hah!  So I was really thrilled with Angel, who was the full time Teaching Assistant for my class suggested I apply to be a TA there.  I then learned that a few people suggested I would make a good TA and well wow, that was really awesome to hear.

So I talked to Tim who set up and interview, afterwards he set up a day for me to do the coding challenge and then I was in!  So now Im working as a part time TA at Wyncode….I get to hang out in my old room...YaY!  Angel just got married and will be out of town for the next week, so I’ll actually be filling in for him full time, but then afterwards, I’ll go on to the regular part timers schedule of working to help students in the afternoons and evenings.

Before Wyncode, I never really considered myself a teaching type. I love to learn, but the only person I’ve ever taught, besides my daughter, is myself. I learned a lot about myself while at Wyncode, one of them being...I also love to help other people understand things and I find it really interesting when they come up with angles and ways of thinking of things I hadn’t thought of.  This is something I’m super excited about...I’m still on the hunt for a full time job and looking forward to continuing to work at Wyncode in the evenings.

Now though, I need to learn React!  Wyncode is always evolving its curriculum, and right after my cohort they started teaching React to the new cohorts.  I’m going to have to put the Wyncode motto “Never Stop Learning” to the test and get myself up and running with React, because the last thing I want is for a student to ask me a question and I have no idea what they are talking about!!  I’m really happy though to already have something new to learn… I still have so much to do, like cleaning up my github, polishing off my projects, looking for work..but I hope to be able to still make time to pick up new skills.
