title: "Wyncode Week 4: Javascript and Team Building"
date: 2018-02-03

Last year, I studied JavaScript on my own with FreeCodeCamp.  It was a rough, 4 months, I struggled through nearly every challenge and project, but I was proud of myself for finishing. In the end, I decided JavaScript was not for me because, what a headache!!!

Fast-forward to now and I've realized it's not that JavaScript isnt for me, but that I spent so many days, weeks, months telling myself how hard it was that that's what became my reality.

This is definitely where growth mindset comes in that Bianca taught us.  I had a real "A-ha!" moment where I was kind of embarrased with myself for being so closed minded about something just because it was hard, but at the same time felt pretty good to recognize that in myself, make the effort to keep an open mind and really make the most of everything I learned this week.

Wanna know what happened?!  Turns out...I freaking love JavaScript! Once I let go of "This is haaaard I dont wanna!" I was left with..."Ohhh, challenging..Im going to figure this out!" JavaScript isnt any easier..but 
I changed my perspective and its now way more fun to get through and write. One thing I'll always love is a challenge.

We ended the week with Team Building... Wyncode catered dinner, we had a couple beers and then we all walked over to a local Escape Room. Now that was awesome!  There were about 5 of us locked in a room with a Spy theme and we had to solve all the clues to get out.  I had always wanted to do something like this, so I was probably a little too excited..hah! I was all bouncy, plus it was the first time I'd taken a break from coding, and thinking, and thinking about coding. We all worked together and made it out within the hour that we had.  Afterwards, most everyone went home and I went back to school to finish my homework because...code life.
